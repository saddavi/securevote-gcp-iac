- Document operational procedures
- Prepare handover documentation

## Day 7: Final Testing & Launch Preparation

_Morning:_

- Conduct full end-to-end testing
- Fix any remaining issues
- Run performance tests

_Afternoon:_

- Deploy to production environment
- Verify all components are working
- Test disaster recovery procedures

_Evening:_

- Final documentation review
- Create presentation slides for the project
- Record a demo video of the working system

## Critical Path Items & Time-Saving Tips

To ensure you complete this in a week:

- **Focus on MVP features first:**
  - Start with basic voting functionality
  - Add fancy features only if time permits
- **Use templates and libraries:**
  - For the frontend, consider using Bootstrap or a UI kit
  - For the API, use a lightweight framework like Express.js
- **Simplify where possible:**
  - Use Firebase Auth instead of building custom auth
  - Consider using managed services like Firebase Hosting for frontend
- **Parallel work strategies:**
  - While Terraform is applying, work on documentation
  - While waiting for approvals, develop tests
- **Combine similar tasks** (e.g., do all IAM work at once)
- **Leverage existing code:**
  - Use your existing Terraform as a foundation
  - Look for open-source components you can adapt

## Is It Possible?

Yes, it's possible to complete this project in a week, especially since you've already done significant infrastructure work. The key is to maintain focus on:

- Core functionality (the voting system itself)
- Security (protecting votes and voters)
- Documentation (proving what you've built)

## Budget Considerations: Staying Under $10/month

To keep costs under the $10/month budget, we'll implement the following strategy:

### Current Monthly Cost Estimates (if resources are always running)

| Resource               | Dev Environment                    | Prod Environment         |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| Cloud SQL              | db-f1-micro (~$7.50/mo)            | db-g1-small (~$30/mo)    |
| Cloud Run              | 0 min instances (~$0, pay per use) | 1 min instance (~$20/mo) |
| Storage (10GB)         | ~$0.50/mo                          | ~$0.50/mo                |
| VPC Connector          | ~$8/mo when active                 | ~$8/mo when active       |
| Secrets & KMS          | ~$1/mo                             | ~$1/mo                   |
| **Total**              | **~$17/mo** (always on)            | **~$60/mo** (always on)  |
| **With cost controls** | **~$2-5/mo**                       | **N/A**                  |

### Budget-Friendly Implementation Plan

1. **Development Environment Only**

   - Skip production environment deployment entirely
   - Focus on fully functional dev environment with cost controls
   - Use existing cost control scripts to minimize expenses

2. **Cost Control Workflow**

   ```
   1. Start resources: ./scripts/start_all_dev_resources.sh
   2. Do development work
   3. Stop resources: ./scripts/stop_all_dev_resources.sh
   ```

3. **Cost Optimization Techniques**

   - Keep VPC connector usage minimal
   - Consider creating/deleting resources instead of keeping them stopped
   - Use Firebase Hosting (free tier) for frontend instead of GCP Storage + Load Balancer
   - Implement Firebase Auth instead of custom authentication

4. **Monitoring Strategy**
   - Set up budget alerts in GCP (notify at 50% and 90% of $10)
   - Weekly cost auditing using `gcloud billing`

By following this strategy, we can maintain project costs at approximately $2-5 per month, well within the $10 budget.
