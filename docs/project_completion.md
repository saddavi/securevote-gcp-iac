- âœ… Created comprehensive schema with users, elections, ballots, votes, and audit tables
- âœ… Implemented database migration scripts (001_initial_schema.sql, 002_indexes.sql)
- âœ… Set up performance optimization with appropriate indexes
- âœ… Configured Cloud SQL instance with private IP for enhanced security

#### 2. API Development

- âœ… Implemented Express.js backend structure
- âœ… Created authentication system with JWT tokens
- âœ… Developed RESTful API endpoints for elections, votes, and results
- âœ… Implemented database connectivity with proper connection pooling
- âœ… Added input validation and security measures

#### 3. Infrastructure as Code

- âœ… Developed Terraform modules for all necessary infrastructure
- âœ… Set up networking with proper VPC configuration
- âœ… Configured Cloud Run service for scalable API hosting
- âœ… Implemented IAM roles with least-privilege principle
- âœ… Created Secret Manager integration for sensitive credentials

#### 4. DevOps & Cost Management

- âœ… Implemented CI/CD scripts for deployment
- âœ… Created resource management scripts for cost control
- âœ… Added comprehensive testing framework
- âœ… Documented development and deployment processes

### Ongoing Tasks

#### 1. Testing

- ðŸ”„ Execute comprehensive API test suite
- ðŸ”„ Validate database migration scripts in production environment
- ðŸ”„ Test resource start/stop scripts for cost management

#### 2. Documentation

- âœ… API documentation created
- âœ… Deployment guide created
- ðŸ”„ Update README with final project status
- ðŸ”„ Document cost monitoring and budget controls

### Cost Control Measures

We've successfully implemented several cost control mechanisms to keep the project under the $10/month budget:

1. **Resource Lifecycle Management**:

   - `scripts/start_all_dev_resources.sh` - Start resources when needed
   - `scripts/stop_all_dev_resources.sh` - Stop resources when not in use
   - `scripts/db_control.sh` - Control database state independently

2. **Scaling Configuration**:

   - Cloud Run configured with minimum instances set to 0 in development
   - Using db-f1-micro tier for Cloud SQL to minimize costs
   - Storage optimized with lifecycle policies

3. **Budget Monitoring**:
   - Set up budget alerts at 50%, 75%, and 90% of $10 threshold
   - Weekly cost reports automated via Cloud Scheduler

### Next Steps

1. **Execute Final Testing**:

   ```bash
   ./scripts/run_api_tests.sh
   ```

2. **Deploy to Production**:

   ```bash
   ENVIRONMENT=prod ./scripts/deploy_api.sh
   ```

3. **Validate Production Deployment**:

   ```bash
   ENVIRONMENT=prod ./scripts/test_connectivity.sh
   ```

4. **Stop Development Resources**:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/stop_all_dev_resources.sh
   ```

## Conclusion

The SecureVote project has successfully implemented all primary requirements with a focus on:

- **Security**: End-to-end encryption, secure authentication, and audit logging
- **Scalability**: Serverless architecture with Cloud Run and Cloud SQL
- **Cost Efficiency**: Stay within $10/month budget through resource control
- **Maintainability**: Comprehensive documentation and infrastructure as code

The system is ready for production deployment following the final testing phase.
