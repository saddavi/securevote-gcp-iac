- Missing variable validations
- Incomplete service account configurations
- Non-modular Terraform structure
- Absent resource tagging strategy

### 1.3 GitHub Actions Issues

## 2. GitHub Actions Implementation

### 2.1 Workflow Improvements

```yaml
name: Terraform CI/CD
on:
  push:
    branches: [main, feature/*]
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  validate:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Setup Terraform
        uses: hashicorp/setup-terraform@v1

      - name: Terraform Format
        run: terraform fmt -check

      - name: Terraform Init
        run: terraform init

      - name: Terraform Validate
        run: terraform validate
```

### 2.2 Security Enhancements

- Implemented secure secret management
- Added service account key rotation
- Configured least privilege access
- Added security scanning steps

### 2.3 Environment Separation

- Created separate workflows for dev/prod
- Implemented environment-specific variables
- Added deployment safeguards
- Configured approval gates for production

## 3. Infrastructure Changes

This section details the infrastructure changes and optimizations made to the SecureVote project, focusing on cost optimization while maintaining functionality for a learning/portfolio project.

### 3.1 Initial State Analysis

- Identified flat Terraform structure
- Found potential cost concerns in infrastructure
- Reviewed existing resources including:
  - Frontend bucket
  - Terraform state bucket
  - Existing start/stop scripts

### 3.2 Infrastructure Modularization

#### 3.2.1 Created Module Structure

```
terraform/
  modules/
    cloud-run/
    database/
    iam/
    networking/
    storage/
  environments/
    dev/
    prod/
```

#### 3.2.2 Fixed Configuration Issues

- Added missing `environment` variable
- Added missing `terraform_service_account_email` to IAM module
- Added missing `service_account_email` to cloud-run module
- Added missing `region` parameter to storage module

### 3.3 Cost Optimization Changes

#### 3.3.1 VPC Networking

- Made VPC components conditional using `enable_vpc` variable
- Updated peering configuration for cost control
- Optimized network settings for development environment

#### 3.3.2 Resource Optimization

##### Cloud Run

- Minimal container resources
- Minimum instances set to 0
- Using free tier capacity

##### Storage

- Retained frontend bucket (cost-effective)
- Using Standard storage class
- Implemented lifecycle rules

##### Database

- Configured for minimal settings
- Integrated with existing start/stop scripts
- Optimized backup retention

## 4. Cost Breakdown

### Development Environment

- Cloud Run: $0-1 (mostly free tier)
- Cloud Storage: $0-1
- Cloud SQL (when needed): $7-9
- VPC (optional): $0-5
  Total Expected: Under $10/month during development

## 5. Operational Scripts

The project maintains three key operational scripts:

- `scripts/db_control.sh`
- `scripts/start_all_dev_resources.sh`
- `scripts/stop_all_dev_resources.sh`

## 6. Security Considerations

Despite cost optimizations, we maintained:

- Proper IAM configurations
- Secure service account setups
- Essential security group rules

## 7. Next Steps

1. Test the cost-optimized infrastructure
2. Complete the 7-day project plan
3. Document the production deployment process
4. Create monitoring dashboards
5. Implement remaining security measures

## 8. Learning Outcomes

This implementation demonstrates:

- Terraform modularization
- Cost optimization strategies
- Infrastructure as Code best practices
- Cloud resource management
- Security implementation
- DevOps processes

## 9. GitHub Actions Status

- Successfully implemented environment-specific deployments
- Added proper checks and validations
- Integrated with modular structure

## 10. Commands Used

```bash
# Branch Creation
git checkout -b feature/modular-architecture

# Terraform Commands
terraform fmt -recursive
terraform init
terraform plan -out=tfplan

# Resource Management
./scripts/start_all_dev_resources.sh
./scripts/stop_all_dev_resources.sh
```

## 11. Important Notes

- Development environment is optimized for cost
- Production environment maintains full functionality
- Start/stop scripts should be used during development
- Monitor GCP billing dashboard regularly

## 12. Future Recommendations

1. Implement auto-shutdown for non-production resources
2. Set up detailed cost allocation tags
3. Create cost optimization dashboards
4. Regular review of resource usage patterns

## 13. Git Workflow Implementation

### 13.1 Branching Strategy

```
main (protected)
  └── feature/modular-architecture
        ├── Infrastructure modularization
        ├── Cost optimization
        └── Security improvements
```

### 13.2 Branch Protection Rules

- Required reviews for main branch
- Status checks must pass
- Up-to-date branch required
- Linear history maintained

### 13.3 Commit Convention

```
feat: Add new feature
fix: Bug fix
refactor: Code restructuring
docs: Documentation updates
ci: CI/CD changes
test: Testing updates
```

### 13.4 Git Commands Used

```bash
# Create and switch to feature branch
git checkout -b feature/modular-architecture

# Stage changes
git add terraform/modules/
git add terraform/environments/
git add .github/workflows/

# Commit with conventional commit messages
git commit -m "refactor: Implement modular infrastructure"
git commit -m "ci: Update GitHub Actions workflow"
git commit -m "fix: Resolve configuration issues"
